In this course, principal cloud technologist Lee Assam introduces you to Amazon Bedrock and gives a foundational understanding of Generative AI and how foundation models (FMs) can be used to solve problems like text summarization, semantic/conversational search, and content generation. Using libraries like Python boto3, LangChain, and Streamlit, you will find out how to build Generative AI applications that leverage Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) using APIs without managing infrastructure. Explore the pre-built FMs available in Amazon Bedrock and the features that Amazon Bedrock provides. Plus, practice what you learn as you build a basic Gen AI application using Amazon Bedrock to demonstrate its capabilities.
